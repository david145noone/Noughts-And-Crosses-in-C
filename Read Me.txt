Ver. 1.0 : 11.10.2018
First version finished. The code works just fine, however, there is no  idication yet from the program that the game
is won or lost yet. Since the character inputs of X and O are stored in an array for the duration of the program I
could add a checker function which evalutes are there 3 X's or O's in the right places of the array to indicate a 
winner.
